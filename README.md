Blender CAD utils
=================

A tiny subset of unmissable CAD functions for Blender 3d.

### OK, what's this all about?

I'll try to keep this short as I'd rather be coding. There is certain functionality found in most dedicated CAD software that I can't live without, namely:  

  - Extend
  - Trim
  - Intersect / weld

For edges these functions exist as Python scripts, and i've bundle them here in the hope they might be useful to you or they might make you angry and you code nicer versions which I will then use instead :)
