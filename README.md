Blender CAD utils
=================

A tiny subset of unmissable CAD functions for Blender 3d.

### OK, what's this all about?

I'll try to keep this short as I'd rather be coding. There is certain functionality found in most dedicated CAD software that I can't live without, namely:  

  - Extend
  - Trim
  - Intersect / weld

For edges these functions exist as Python scripts, and i've bundle them here in the hope they might be useful to you or they might make you angry and you code nicer versions which I will then use instead :)

### Why on github?

The issue tracker, use it. Let me know if these things are broken in new relesaes. Why? I don't update Blender as often as some so am oblivious to the slow evolution. Secondly; the ussue tracker. use it. If you can make a valid argument for extra functionality and it seems like something I might use or be able to implement for fun, it's going to happen. Thirdly, the issue tracker; use it. I'm always open to pull requests (just don't expect instant approval of something massive, we can talk..you can use your gift of persuasion to lull me into accepting it)
